This mod allows you to buy influence from the Artisan Enclave, by running propaganda campaigns.

The propaganda campaigns are implemented in the same way as for the trade companies: a constant drain on resources that can be cancelled at any time.

The cost of a propaganda campaign is very expensive (20 minerals + 20 energy per 1 influence) - but I think it's a reasonable way to pick up influence without simply cheating.

[h1]Technical info / compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*]Edited the guardian.300 event (the "front screen" of the Artisan Enclave), to act as a gateway into this mod.
[*]Edited the guardian.330 event, so that the Propaganda Campaign is removed if you annoy the Artisans. (Not tested.)
[*]Edited the guardian.333 event, so that the Propaganda Campaign is removed if all of the Artisan Enclaves are destroyed. (Not tested.)
[*]No other vanilla files are edited, so this mod should be compatible with anything that doesn't alter the Artisan Enclave.[/list]
