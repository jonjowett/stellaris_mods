Allows you to buy influence from the Artisan Enclave, by running propaganda campaigns.

This is very expensive (20 minerals + 20 energy per 1 influence) - but I think it's a reasonable way to pick up influence without simply cheating.

--------------------

Technical info / compatibility:
 --- Edited the "front screen" of the Artisan Enclave (guardian.300 in events\guardian_events.txt), to act as a gateway into this mod.
 --- No other vanilla files are edited, so this mod should be compatible with anything that doesn't alter the Artisan Enclave.

All of my mods are available on [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/stellaris_mods]Github[/url] (eg. in case you want to revert to an earlier version)

Tested version: 1.8.3

Ironman compatible: Yes

Achievement compatible: No

Required DLC: Leviathans

--------------------

CHANGELOG:

v0.1 Initial upload, not playtested
v0.2 Uploaded cleaner version that's compatible with 1.6.1 and 1.8.3. (guardian.300 didn't change)
v0.3 Uploaded cleaner version that properly replicates the vanilla guardian.300 event. This version is probably not compatible with 1.6.1.
