This mod allows you to buy influence from the Artisan Enclave, by running propaganda campaigns.
[list][*]Each propaganda campaign is an empire-level modifier that gives you influence in exchange for a constant drain on resources.

[*]Campaigns last for 10 years, after which time you will be prompted to renew.

[*]Campaigns can be cancelled at any time.

[*]The cost of each campaign is scaled to your empire size (capping-out at 240 pops).

[*]Ongoing campaigns increase the trust between your empire and the Artisan Enclave.[/list]

[h1]Available Campaigns:[/h1]

Because of the variable nature of the costs, it's significantly easier to read these from the in-game dialog. However, for reference, here's a full list of the campaigns and their cost structure. (The key is at the bottom of this section.)

[h1]Minor features:[/h1]
[list][*]Backwards compatibility
[list][*]If you continue a game where you were using the old version of this mod, everything will be upgraded smoothly the next time you talk to the artists about propaganda campaigns. 
[*]If you don't want to lose your old and extremely-underpriced propaganda campaign, you have two choices: (1) don't talk to the artists about propaganda campaigns; (2) use the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1682019056]old version of this mod[/url].[/list][/list]

[h1]Upcoming features:[/h1]
[list][*]Flavour events for each type of campaign. (Ideally, multiple possible events per campaign - both good and bad.)[/list]

[h1]Known Bugs:[/h1]
[list][*]The screenshots are out of date.[/list]

[h1]Technical info / compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*]Edited the leviathans.300 event (the "front screen" of the Artisan Enclave), to act as a gateway into this mod.
[*]Edited the leviathans.330 event, so that propaganda campaigns are removed if you annoy the Artisans. (Not tested.)
[*]Edited the leviathans.333 event, so that propaganda campaigns are removed if all of the Artisan Enclaves are destroyed. (Not tested.)
[*]No other vanilla files are edited, so this mod should be compatible with anything that doesn't alter the Artisan Enclave.[/list]

[h1]Earlier versions / Beta versions:[/h1]
[list][*]All of my mods are available on [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/stellaris_mods]Github[/url] (eg. in case you want to revert to an earlier version)[/list]

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
