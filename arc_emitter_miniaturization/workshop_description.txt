Ever wanted to create battleships with nothing but arc emitters? Battleships that laugh at your enemies' so-called "shields", "armour" and "evasion"?

This mod adds Large-sized arc emitters to the game ("Miniaturized Arc Emitter" and "Miniaturized Focused Arc Emitter").

The new weapon stats have been derived from the vanilla XL weapons, following the patterns established by other weapons (eg. Cloud Lightning; Giga Cannon vs Kinetic Artillery).

This mod also adds two new technologies to the game, which are required to unlock the new weapons.

[h1]Rationale:[/h1]

I personally love the mechanics of the XL Arc Emitters as flavourful endgame weapons - but unfortunately there are no similar mechanics in the L weapon class. (Other than Cloud Lightning, which is not guaranteed in every run and which is distinctly underpowered in the late game because it's supposed to be an early-game weapon.) This means that the L weapons on your battleships have to cut through armour and shields even though your XL weapons bypass all that, which means that XL Arc Emitters are highly suboptimal.
