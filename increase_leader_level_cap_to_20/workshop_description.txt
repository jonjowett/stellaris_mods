This micro-mod increases the maximum leader level cap to 20.

This means that, if you somehow manage to obtain a large number of modifiers to leader level cap (from tech / traditions / traits / etc), your leaders will be able to progress beyond level 10. (But they will not be able to progress beyond level 20.)

[h1]Known Bugs:[/h1]
[list][*]The icons for levels 11-20 aren't displayed in-game. (Because they don't exist: I made artwork for the old star-based leader icons, but that's now outdated and I haven't got around to producing artwork in the new style.)[/list]
