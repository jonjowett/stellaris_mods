[b][u]This mod is not required for the current version of the game (v2.2.4), as the base game already has COMMAND_LIMIT_MAX set to 500.[/u][/b]

---

This micro-mod increases the maximum fleet capacity to 500.

The reason for this is that, in the base game (v2.0.1):
[list][*] Fleet capacity is capped at 200
[*] There are repeatable techs that increase fleet cap by +10 per level
[*] You can reach 200 fleet cap by researching all non-repeatable techs and taking all relevant traditions.[/list]

[h1]Technical Info / Compatibility[/h1]
[list][*] This mod should be compatible with every other mod that doesn't alter the same line in the defines file (ie. NGameplay -> FLEET_COMMAND_LIMIT).[/list]

[list][*]All of my mods are available on [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/stellaris_mods]Github[/url] (eg. in case you want to revert to an earlier version)[/list]
