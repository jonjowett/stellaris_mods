This mod adds 10 new unity ambitions, which add permanent buffs to your empire. Each of these buffs has 5 levels (Initial / Improved / Advanced / Extreme / Maximal).

This gives you the ability to use unity to permanently improve your late-game empire, in ways that are not possible with repeatable technologies.

[h1]Known bugs:[/h1]
[list][*] Decreased megastructure build cost is no longer present in vanilla, so this aspect may not work properly. It is definitely not correctly localised (ie. the description of the effect is missing), but this is a purely-cosmetic issue. However, I haven't done much testing on this mod as yet, and this effect is the most likely to break in some weird way, so please let me know if you encounter any bugs.[/list]

[h1]Suggested companion mods:[/h1]
[list][*] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1326068324]Increase Leader Level Cap to 20[/url] - so that you can get the full benefit of the "Unify Leaders" buff.[/list]

[h1]Technical info & compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*] This is a clean mod - no vanilla files are overwritten. As such, it should be compatible with any mod that doesn't drastically alter the core game.
[*] The Unified Roboticists buff is split in two internally - different buffs for machine and biological empires.
[*] The buffs should be properly gated if you don't have the necessary DLC (ie. you shouldn't be able to select them if you can't use them). But I have not fully tested this.[/list]
