This mod adds 8 new unity ambitions, which add permanent buffs to your empire. Each of these buffs has 5 levels (Initial / Improved / Advanced / Extreme / Maximal).

This gives you the ability to use unity to permanently improve your late-game empire, in ways that are not possible with repeatable technologies.

[list][*] Unified Diplomats (+1 influence per level)
[*] Unified Researchers (+10% research speed per level)
[*] Unified Logistics Corps (+10% naval capacity per level)
[*] Unified Civil Engineers (+20% megastructure build speed and -5% megastructure build cost per level)
[*] Unified Military Engineers (+5% fire rate and +5% weapons range per level)

[*] Unified Roboticists (requires the ability to robomod):
[list][*] +10% robot build speed per level
[*] +1 to +3 robot/machine trait points
[*] 0% to 20% species modification cost reduction
[*] Research options for additional robomodding points are granted at levels 1 and 3, if you don't already have them[/list][/list]

[h1]Technical info & compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*] This is a clean mod - no vanilla files are overwritten. As such, it should be compatible with any mod that doesn't drastically alter the core game.
[*] The Unified Roboticists buff is split in two internally - different buffs for machine and biological empires.
[*] The buffs should be properly gated if you don't have the necessary DLC (ie. you shouldn't be able to select them if you can't use them). But I have not fully tested this.[/list]

[h1]Suggested companion mods:[/h1]
[list][*] In order to get full use of the Unified Leaders buff, you should also install a mod that increases the maximum leader level cap.[/list]
