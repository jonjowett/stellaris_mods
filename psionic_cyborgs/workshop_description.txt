This mod allows you to select multiple ascension paths - ie. you can create genetically-perfected psionic cyborgs. 

In vanilla, you have to choose between the biological (genetic engineering) path, the technological (cyborg/synthetic) path and the spiritual (psychic/psionic) path. However, I don't think that there's any good reason for these paths to be completely mutually exclusive - hence this mod.

For reference, here's the full list of ascension perk lockouts if this mod is running:
[list][*][b]Engineered Evolution[/b] - Not permitted if you are a machine empire.

[*][b]Evolutionary Mastery[/b] - Not permitted if you are a machine empire.

[*][b]The Flesh Is Weak[/b] - Not permitted if you are a machine empire or a biological hive mind.

[*][b]Synthetic Evolution[/b] - Not permitted if you are a machine empire, or a biological hive mind, or if you have "Mind Over Matter". (The latter is justified because various in-game events make it clear that you lose your soul - and hence all psionic powers - if you become synths.)

[*][b]Mind Over Matter[/b] - Not permitted if you are a machine empire, or a biological hive mind, or if you have "Synthetic Evolution" (see above).

[*][b]Transcendence[/b] - Not permitted if you are a machine empire, or a biological hive mind, or if you have "Synthetic Evolution" (see above).[/list]

This mod also adds a free edict that fixes your leaders' traits. (Because sometimes they don't get the correct combination of psychic, cyborg and/or erudite.) The AI will not use this edict (because: it's free, so the AI would probably try to use it continuously, which would probably cause performance issues).

[h1]Technical info / compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*]This mod will not be compatible with any other mod that alters any of the 6 ascension perks listed above.

[*]The psionic, cyborg and erudite [u]species[/u] traits have had their mutual lockouts removed. Therefore, this mod will not be compatible with any mod that alters these traits.
