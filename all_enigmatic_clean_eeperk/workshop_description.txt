[b][u]NB: You should almost certainly use the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1196859854]base version[/url] of this mod, rather than this version![/u][/b]

This is a version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1196859854]All Enigmatic Technologies (Clean)[/url], where the dark matter techs can be unlocked by either:
[list][*] defeating the enigmatic fortress and then researching both the encoder & decoder; or
[*] selecting the Enigmatic Engineering ascension perk[/list]

The second option (ie. the option newly added by this mod) is, in my opinion, far too easy. Using this mod will almost certainly make the game too easy for the player.
