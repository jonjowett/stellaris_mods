This micro-mod grants you the ability to research Dark Matter Deflectors, Dark Matter Reactors and the Enigmatic Disruption Field by defeating the Enigmatic Fortress - there is no need to reverse-engineer Fallen Empire tech.

In order to unlock these techs, you need to finish researching [u]both[/u] the Enigmatic Encoder [u]and[/u] the Enigmatic Decoder. In addition, you need to finish researching the relevant prerequisite tech:
[list][*]Dark Matter Deflectors - requires Hyper Shields
[*]Dark Matter Reactors - requires Zero Point Power
[*]Dark Matter Thrusters - requires Impulse Thrusters
[*]Enigmatic Disruption Field - requires Titans[/list]

The Enigmatic Disruption Field is equivalent to a Shield Dampener plus a Quantum Destabilizer, combined into one component.

[h1]Inspiration:[/h1]
[list][*]This mod was inspired by the original [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=922899798]All Enigmatic Technologies[/url] mod by Sam.
[*]Unfortunately, that mod edits the technologies themselves, which means that it's not 100% compatible with other mods (and it also requires updates every time Paradox changes the vanilla technologies).[/list]

[h1]FAQ:[/h1]
[list][*][u]Is this mod save-game compatible?[/u]
Yes.
You can safely add this mod to a save game that was already in progress (but you may need to wait awhile for the event to appear - see below). You can also remove this mod without harming your save (because the mod only adds events and country-level flags).[/list]

[h1]Technical info / compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*]This mod is CLEAN - no vanilla files are altered. Hence, it should be compatible with all other mods.
[*]The tech research options are granted by event, which is triggered by completing research on any tech. This is seamless for new games - but, if you are adding this mod to a game in progress where you have already researched an Enigmatic tech, you will need to wait until you've finished researching some other tech.
[*]The Enigmatic Disruption Field is implemented as a new component and is clearly tagged in Ship Designer (so you can choose to use the vanilla component if it's fixed at some point in the future, or a version that's fixed by some other mod).[/list]

[h1]Earlier versions / Beta versions:[/h1]
[list][*]All of my mods are available on [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/stellaris_mods]Github[/url] (eg. in case you want to revert to an earlier version)[/list]

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
[list][*]Tested version: 2.2.5
[*]Required DLC: Leviathans
[*]Ironman compatible: Yes
[*]Achievement compatible: No[/list]
