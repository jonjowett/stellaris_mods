Since patch 1.6, you can only obtain one technology from the Enigmatic Fortress.

This micro-mod:
 --- Grants you the ability to research all Enigmatic technologies once you have finished researching one of them.
 --- Fixes the Enigmatic Distruption Field, so it can be used on military stations.

--------------------

Inspiration:
 --- This mod was inspired by the original [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=922899798]All Enigmatic Technologies[/url] mod by Sam: 
 --- Unfortunately, that mod edits the technologies themselves, which means that it's not 100% compatible with other mods (and it also requires updates every time Paradox changes the vanilla technologies).

--------------------

Technical info / compatibility:
 --- This mod is CLEAN - no vanilla files are altered. Hence, it should be compatible with all other mods.
 --- The Enigmatic tech research options are granted by event, which is triggered by completing research on any tech. This is seamless for new games - but, if you are adding this mod to a game in progress where you have already researched an Enigmatic tech, you will need to wait until you've finished researching some other tech.
 --- The fixed Enigmatic Disruption Field is implemented as a new component and is clearly tagged in Ship Designer (so you can choose to use the vanilla component if it's fixed at some point in the future, or a version that's fixed by some other mod).
