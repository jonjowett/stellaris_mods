This mod allows you to build a megastructure (the Hyperlane Isolator) that removes [u]all[/u] hyperlanes that link to a system.

This is an addon for the existing [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1317527025]Hyperlane Generation[/url] mod by Khadgar. If you want to use this mod, you [b][u]must[/u][/b] also subscribe to that one!

The cost of each stage of the Hyperlane Isolator is 6 times that of the equivalent stage of an individual receptor/emitter, and it takes twice as long to build. (In other words, it costs as much as removing 3 hyperlanes using the base mod, but takes slightly less time.)

[h1]Suggested Companion Mods:[/h1]

[list][*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1310625695]More Hyperlane Chokepoints[/url] - As per the mod name, this alters the galaxy generation script to create more chokepoints. (This is better than simply turning down the number of hyperlanes in the new game screen.)[/list]

[h1]Technical info & compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*] This is a clean mod - no vanilla files are overwritten. As such, it should be compatible with any mod that doesn't drastically alter the core game.
[*] As noted above, you [b][u]must[/u][/b] also subscribe to the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1317527025]Hyperlane Generation[/url] mod by Khadgar.
[*] If a system has more than 10 hyperlanes (!), only 10 randomly-chosen hyperlanes will be removed.
[*] It is safe to add this mod to a game that's already in progress.
[*] Before removing this mod from a game, you should ensure that there are no part-completed Hyperlane Isolators anywhere in the galaxy. (If you don't the game probably won't break, but you might have some weird effects.)[/list]
