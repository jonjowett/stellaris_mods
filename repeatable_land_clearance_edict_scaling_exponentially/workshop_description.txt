This micro-mod allows you to repeat the "Mastery of Nature" planetary decision (granted by the "World Shaper" ascension perk).

The cost for this repeatable decision scales exponentially, to model the increasing difficulty of clearing more land for development:
[list][*]Mastery of Nature: 100 influence + 2000 energy (base game; requires "World Shaper")
[*]Mastery of Nature (Repeated): 200 influence + 4000 energy
[*]Mastery of Nature (Repeated x2): 400 influence + 8000 energy
[*]Mastery of Nature (Repeated x3): 800 influence + 16000 energy
[*]Mastery of Nature (Repeated x4): 1600 influence + 32000 energy
[*]Mastery of Nature (Repeated x5): 3200 influence + 64000 energy[/list]

In every other way, the repeatable Mastery of Nature decision is exactly the same as in the base game. In particular, each additional level adds +2 max districts.

[h1]Inspiration:[/h1]

This mod was inspired by Asteyr's [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1310571069]Repeatable Land Clearance Edict mod[/url].

I made my own version because I felt that that mod's costs were too small (it was far too easy to max out the planet size) - and also because that mod gave much more land per edict than in the base game.

[h1]FAQ:[/h1]

[u]Influence is capped at 1000, so why do edicts 4 & 5 require more than 1000 influence?[/u]
Edict cost can be reduced significantly, even in vanilla (and other mods might add more sources of edict cost reduction). Similarly the influence cap can be increased by mods. Edict #4 is definitely possible (but rather expensive) without requiring other mods. Edict #5 is included for completeness, in case it becomes possible in conjunction with other mods.

[u]Do I have to take the World Shaper ascension perk to be able to use this repeatable edict?[/u]
Yes.

[u]Can the AI take this decision?[/u]
In theory, yes. However, I haven't observed this in practice. In any case, I think it is unlikely that the AI will take anything beyond the first one or two decisions, as they are unlikely to save up enough influence.

[h1]Technical Info / Compatibility[/h1]
[list][*]No vanilla files are altered, so this mod should be fully compatible with every other mod.
[*]It's probably not a good idea to have more than one land clearance mod running simultaneously!
[*]This mod is safe to add to a game in progress.
[*]This mod is [u]risky[/u] to remove from a game in progress. (For example, I don't know how the game will handle planets that are suddenly too big.)[/list]
