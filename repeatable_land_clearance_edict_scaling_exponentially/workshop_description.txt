This micro-mod changes the "Land Clearance" planetary edict (granted by the "World Shaper" ascension perk) into a repeatable edict.

The cost for this repeatable edict scales exponentially, to model the increasing difficulty of clearing more land for development:
[list][*]Land Clearance: 100 influence + 500 energy (base game; requires "World Shaper")
[*]Repeatable Land Clearance 1: 200 influence + 1000 energy
[*]Repeatable Land Clearance 2: 400 influence + 2000 energy
[*]Repeatable Land Clearance 3: 800 influence + 4000 energy
[*]Repeatable Land Clearance 4: 1600 influence + 8000 energy
[*]Repeatable Land Clearance 5: 3200 influence + 16000 energy[/list]

In every other way, the repeatable land clearance edict is exactly the same as in the base game. In particular, the number of extra tiles created is the same:
[list][*]3 tiles created if planet size is <= 12
[*]2 tiles created if planet size is <= 15 (and > 12)
[*]1 tile created if planet size is <=24 (and > 15)
[*]0 tiles created if planet size is 25  (edict is hidden because it cannot be enacted)[/list]

[h1]Inspiration:[/h1]

This mod was inspired by Asteyr's [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1310571069]Repeatable Land Clearance Edict mod[/url].

I made my own version because I felt that that mod's costs were too small (it was far too easy to increase planet size to 25) - and also because that mod gave much more land per edict than in the base game.

[h1]FAQ:[/h1]

[u]Influence is capped at 1000, so why do edicts 4 & 5 require more than 1000 influence?[/u]
Edict cost can be reduced significantly, even in vanilla (and other mods might add more sources of edict cost reduction). Similarly the influence cap can be increased. Edict #4 is possible (but rather expensive) without requiring other mods. Edict #5 is included for completeness, in case it becomes possible in conjunction with other mods.

[u]Do I have to take the World Shaper ascension perk to be able to use this repeatable edict?[/u]
Yes.

[h1]Technical Info / Compatibility[/h1]
[list][*]No vanilla files are altered, so this mod should be fully compatible with every other mod.
[*]It's probably not a good idea to have more than one land clearance mod running simultaneously![/list]
