#Any single planet should only have ONE of these modifiers.

#mastery_of_nature is a prerequisite for the user to select mastery_of_nature_rlcse_1.
#However, I have decided NOT to remove the vanilla mastery_of_nature modifier if the user/AI takes one of the decisions added by this mod.
#(This is so that I can preserve the vanilla mastery_of_nature decision.)
#Therefore, if a planet has the m_o_n_r_X modifier, then it will also have the m_o_n modifier.
#This means that the total effect of a planet having m_o_n_r_X is actually 2 greater than the value shown below.
