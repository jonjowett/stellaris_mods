This micro-mod:
 --- Allows all megastructures to be built and upgraded simultaneously (if you can afford the cost).
 --- Allows you to build more than one Science Nexus and/or Dyson Sphere.

--------------------

Technical info / compatibility:
 --- This mod OVERRIDES the vanilla ringworld, nexus and sphere megastructures. Therefore, it will be incompatible with any other mod that alters these megastructures.
 --- The megastructures generated by this mod are the same as the vanilla ones. Therefore, it should be safe to continue a save (with megastructures) after turning this mod off. (But this is not tested!)
 --- Simultaneous repair of ancient ruined megastructures *should* also be covered by this mod - but I haven't been able to test them all.
