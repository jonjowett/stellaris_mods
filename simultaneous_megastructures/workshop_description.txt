[h1]FAQ:[/h1]

Q: Can you add support for multiple-construction of gateways?
A: It is currently (v2.0.1) impossible to build multiple "gateway construction sites" at the same time. (It is possible to activate multiple gateways at the same time; and building the gateway construction site doesn't block any other megastructure construction/upgrades.) This appears to be a bug in the base game, and I am not planning to fix it in this mod.

[h1]Technical info / compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*]This mod OVERRIDES the vanilla ringworld, nexus and sphere megastructures. Therefore, it will be incompatible with any other mod that alters these megastructures.
[*]The megastructures generated by this mod are the same as the vanilla ones. Therefore, it should be safe to continue a save (with megastructures) after turning this mod off. (But this is not tested!)
[*]Simultaneous repair of ancient ruined megastructures is also covered by this mod. (But I haven't been able to test them all.)[/list]

[h1]Earlier versions / Beta versions:[/h1]
[list][*]All of my mods are available on [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/stellaris_mods]Github[/url] (eg. in case you want to revert to an earlier version)[/list]

[h1]TLDR:[/h1]
[list][*]Tested version: 2.0.1
[*]Required DLC: Utopia (allows megastructure construction)
[*]Ironman compatible: Yes
[*]Achievement compatible: No[/list]
