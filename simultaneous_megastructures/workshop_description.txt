[h1]FAQ:[/h1]

Q: Why aren't gateways or habitats altered by this mod?
A: Gateways and habitats already have the required "construction_blocks_others = no" line in their specification. If it is impossible to build multiple simultaneous gateways/habitats (as it was for gateways in v2.0.1), that's a bug in the vanilla game that I cannot fix.

[h1]Technical info / compatibility:[/h1]
[list][*]This mod OVERRIDES the following vanilla megastructures: ringworld, sphere, spy orb, nexus, decompressor, strategic center, art installation, interstellar assembly. Therefore, it will be incompatible with any other mod that alters these megastructures.

[*]Simultaneous repair of ancient ruined megastructures is covered by this mod (as noted above), but I haven't been able to test them all.

[*]It is safe to add this mod to an existing save.

[*]It is probably safe to continue a game after removing this mod. However, this has not been tested - proceed with care![/list]
